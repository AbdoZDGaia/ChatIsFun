# chatisfun

A new Flutter app demonstrating my design skills + implementing the accumulated knowledge gained in the past month's self-study flutter coding camp.

The project's aimed towards the UI principles of the app rather than the back-end (since an actual chatting app would need and actual back-end "authentication and database").
